# lern-jwt

This is a full stack application consisting of Level, Express, React and Node.js. It was developed around RBAC which guards the `/api/private` url. The url has been configured to execute `docker` inside `docker` container but it can be configured to run mostly anything.

Local:
`npm run setup && npm run build && npm run server-prod`

Docker:
`npm run compose && npm run up`
